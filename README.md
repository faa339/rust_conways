# Conway's Game of Life in Rust 
Not much to this project, thrown together with the help of [clap](https://crates.io/crates/clap) for easy cli parsing. Hoping to still add initial board option (i.e. pass in a desired starting board to see how it evolves) but putting this up here in the meantime.

To run: cargo run \<generations\> [width of board] [height of board]
